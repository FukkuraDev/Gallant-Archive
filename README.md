We're keeping track of the things Paul has been up to.

To write content, you can add `MDX` files into the `content` directory. The `build` task generates JSON files for the projects and updates so that we can show render the listings. At the moment, that means that `dev` won't refresh them.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
